# Electronic-Circuit-Design-Project
we make a variable DC power supply and the main working principle of this project is full wave rectification which is done by bridge configuration. Where we are using 4 diodes and those rectifies the output of the step-down transformer, that step down the 220 AC volts to 24 AC volts. In this circuit we have use capacitor C1 are used to get constant input to the regulator. Moreover, it also helps to reduce the sharp peaks in the output. The 1000 μ F capacitor are used to reduce the noise and ripples produce by the regulators. So that the regulated output has less ripples. We are also using a voltage regulator that gives constant voltage, which gives 6 volts  and it is IC LM317 Voltage regulator. Now the main task is to get variable output and  for this we use Variable resistor 10kΩ to increase the output of the regulator and in  which resistance is variable. So, when we increase or decrease the value of that resistor  the output voltage of the regulator will also change accordingly and we get a range of 1.5V to 22V variable voltage.
